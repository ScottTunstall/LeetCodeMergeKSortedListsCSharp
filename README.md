# LeetCodeMergeKSortedListsCSharp

My solution to the https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/ HARD problem.

This wasn't hard at all - I figured out the algorithm first time. And it worked. So I didn't code up unit tests, no point!

Runtime: 452 ms, faster than 24.83% of C# online submissions for Merge k Sorted Lists.

Memory Usage: 29.7 MB, less than 75.71% of C# online submissions for Merge k Sorted Lists.


This is to help you understand the algorithm (and hopefully improve on it) . 

You are not permitted to submit my code, or derivatives thereof, to Leetcode.  Don't be a cheat!
